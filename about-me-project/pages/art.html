            <h2>What Sparked My Art Journey?</h2>
             <img src="../images/grandma.jpeg" alt="Grandma's Art">
            <p>I dedicate the spark for my art journey to my Grandma. Since I was a little girl, I found interest in molding play-doh, 
                creating dreamcatchers, and doing paint-by-numbers. I would not be the artist I am today without the molding of my Grandma's advice.
                I grew up with her by my side telling me that, <q>it's okay to draw outside of the lines</q>, <q>it's okay to make a 
                mess on the table</q>, and <q>it's okay to follow your creative intuition</q>. I even had my own designated craft drawer
                in her house that we bonded through. Her artistic style followed abstraction; unrecognizable figures and dots 
                were her favorite.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Medium</h2>
             <img src="../images/butterfly 1.jpg" alt="Butterfly Painting">
             
             <p>My absolute favorite medium is oil paint. Ironically, my first time using oil paint was during an art
                 class at MCC in 2019. I consider myself to be a messy artist; oil paint allows me to be messy by not
                  having to clean my brush, and blending colors. It takes a few days for oil paint to dry, allowing the
                   paint to be manipulated and blended easily. This is my 30" x 36" oil painting from the 2020 MCC Voices magazine 
                   of a close-up of an American Painted Lady Butterfly. The whole painting was done with the technique of dots.</p>

             <img src="../images/chance.jpg" alt="Rapper Painting">
            <p>Acrylic paint is my second favorite medium. Its ability to dry quick allows for layering different 
                colors efficiently. Since it is a synthetic medium, the vibrancy is very apparent. This acrylic piece 
                that I made is of Chance the Rapper. The process began with taking a snapshot from a music video of 
                the group Donnie and the Trumpets. I then edited the exposure, highlights and saturation in the photo, 
                which I used for my reference. I ultilized the color blocking technique to create the shadows and
                 highlights on the figure. </p>

            <h2>Commissions</h2>
             <img src="../images/bike.jpg" alt="Bike Painting">
            <p>Alongside working, I do commissions on the side. These commissions have consisted of paintings, 
                logos, t-shirt designs, and custom clothing. This particular commission I completed for a customer
                 who wanted a documentation of his worldy travels. I transformed his photo from Budva, Montenegro 
                 into an oil painting. Its dimensions are 24"x 36", and is now happily hung on a wall in Utah. 
                 This painting took six months to fully complete. </p>
