            <h2>What Sparked My Art Journey?</h2>
             <img src="../images/volleyball.jpeg" alt="Volleyball">
            <p>I dedicate the spark for my art journey to my Grandma. Since I was a little girl, I found interest in molding play-doh, 
                creating dreamcatchers, and doing paint-by-numbers. This soon evolved into creating large canvas paintings, commissions,
                and custom clothing. Although I would not be the artist I am today without the molding of my Grandma's advice.
                I grew up with her by my side telling me that, <q>it's okay to draw outside of the lines</q>, <q>it's okay to make a 
                mess on the table</q>, and <q>it's okay to follow your creative intuition</q> I even had my own designated craft drawer
                in her house that we bonded through. Her artistic style followed abstraction; unrecognizable figures and dots 
                were her favorite.</p>
