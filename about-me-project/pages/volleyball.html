            <h2>Start Of My Volleyball Journey</h2>
             <img src="../images/volleyball.jpeg" alt="Volleyball">
            <p>My volleyball career started in middle school. I played st Lundahl Middle school, 
                and did summer camps. Then I transitioned to playing at Crystal Lake Highschool.
                 While in my school off-season I played club volleyball at Sky High. I played 
                 many positions depending on the team: outside hitter, setter, and libero/defensive 
                 specialist. Although, because of my height, it was common that I was put as the libero.
                 The libero is known for defense and passing. They are the player that wears a 
                 different colored jersey. This allows the libero to sub out with a hitter without 
                 having to be accepted by the referee.</p>

             <img src="../images/indoor-vball.jpeg" alt="Indoor Volleyball">
            <p>I do regret not playing volleyball in college, however I still stay active in 
                the sport. I currently partcipate in 4 different leagues, and open gyms. I play
                beach volleyball through Kingston Lanes in the summer, as well as the fall. I
                play in a women's competitive league that is held through a middle school, and
                a men's competitive league that is held at Lifezone 360.</p>

            <h2>Why Volleyball Is My Favorite Sport</h2>
             <img src="../images/beach-vball.jpeg" alt="Beach Volleyball">
            <p>Volleyball is my favorite sport for many reasons. The first being that it 
                forces you to be fully aware in the present. I also enjoy the cardio aspect
                 of volleyball. My favorite part of the sport is the physical demand. 
                 I love throwing my body on the floor with volleyball rolls, hitting the
                  ball front-row, and blocking at the net.</p>
