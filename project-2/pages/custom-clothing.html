    <p>I fell in love with creating custom clothing. 
        I was inspired by streetwear from stores online,
        and wanting to recreate clothing for myself by hand.
        I have created more custom clothing for other people
        than for myself. I have made sweatpants, sweatshirts,
        t-shirts, jeans, and more. In order to make a custom piece,
        I mix acrylic paint with a textile medium. The textile
        medium makes the paint secure to the fabric so that you 
        are able to wash and dry the piece with no problem.
        I have received many requests to do custom clothing with
        anime characters on it. So many of my custom pieces I
        have made are more cartoon based. </p>
