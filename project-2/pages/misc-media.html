    <p>I really got into watercolor during my college art career.
        I took a watercolor course which sparked my love for the 
        medium. You must have a lot of patience to work with 
        watercolor because it is layers upon layers of paint.
        Because it is mixed with water, this medium also takes
        a long time to dry.  

        This is my favorite painting that I have created in watercolor.
        It is a still-life snapshot from a dinner with my family at
        a sushi resturant. I like it because of the color palette
        and the realism that is shown. </p>
