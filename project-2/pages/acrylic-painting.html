    <p>I also enjoy acrylic painting. I have used acrylics for most
        of my life, but have really learned the medium within the past 
        5 years. It dries very quickly which allows you to work fast.
        I typically use acrylic paints for a wide variety of subjects.
        This could include realism, abstraction, and other genres. 

        This is a painting that I made with no plan going into it.
        I named it “Unknown” because I was not certain of how the
        painted was going to end up. I added lots of layers and
        different things until I was satisfied. </p>
