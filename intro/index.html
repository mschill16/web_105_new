    <h1>Morgan's Favorite things to do</h1>
    <p>Morgan is such a kind person!</p>
    <h2>Volleyball</h2>
    <h3>Indoor and Outdoor Leagues</h3>
    <p>I play in four different volleyball leagues throughout the different seasons. I play outdoor sand volleyball in the summer and fall. I play indoor court volleyball in the fall, winter, and spring. It is one of my favorite things to do in my free time.</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <h3>Oil Painting</h3>
    <p>Although I enjoy many mediums, oil paint is my favorite. It allows me to be the messy artist that I am. I was featured in the MCC Voices magazine for one of my oil paintings when I went here in 2019.</p>

    <h2>Thrifting</h2>
    <h3>Goodwill</h3>
    <p>Thrifting is one of my hobbies. I enjoy searching through clothes and items to find those that speak to my style. Goodwill and Savers are two of my go-to spots.</p>
